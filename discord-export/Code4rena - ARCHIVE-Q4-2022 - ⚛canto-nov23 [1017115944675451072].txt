"Stable pairs follow the x^3y + y^3x = k CF curve invariant. While stable pairs follow the regular constant-product CF invariant, xy = k, where x and y are the reserves of the assets in the pool."


[09/07/2022 20:08] rokinot
i think there was some confusion here


[09/07/2022 20:17] chicagoguy#9197
Apologies for that that was a typo

It’s supposed to say volatile pairs follow the xy = k invariant curve


[09/07/2022 20:18] devtooligan
"stable pair" defined as 2 stable coins (ex USDC/USDT), correct?


[09/07/2022 20:18] rokinot
ah ok


[09/07/2022 20:18] chicagoguy#9197
Yes that’s correct. In Cantos case this would be usdc, usdt or Note

In the contest description we specified which functions were modified. This ended up coming out to 160 SLOC. The rest of the code is directly from the Solidly swap code which we did not modify.

did anyone manage to run `yarn install --lock-file` succecssfully?


[09/08/2022 07:55] soosh4618
for me an error shows but can just run `npx hardhat test` as normal


[09/08/2022 07:57] cryptphi
mine through some dependencies errors, fixed all that but couldn't run `npx hardhat test` successful, throws a mocha related error


[09/08/2022 07:58] cryptphi
probably the build had some errors...will delete and try again


[09/08/2022 08:25] csanuragjain
Is anyone from Canto team available currently. Have few questions


[09/08/2022 09:18] cryptphi
the test files output seems fixed no matter how much you add or edit them. npx hardhat test will output the same result from original run


[09/08/2022 09:28] illilli000
did you try the all in one command? what is the error part of its output?


[09/08/2022 09:58] cryptphi
thanks got resolved eventually. I think i had one module missing, got it fixed after installing it.


[09/08/2022 10:00] illilli000
and all your tests are working now too?  seeing changes?


[09/08/2022 10:13] cryptphi
the tests run as they are meant to. But when I edit the test file and run again, it only outputs the original test results, doesn't effect the change I made in the file


[09/08/2022 10:18] illilli000
can you do me a favor and try running the all-in-one command in another directory, making the test change there, and running it? I think something you've done may have messed things up. I just tried it with the all in one and everything works fine


[09/08/2022 10:25] cryptphi
I see, thanks... but seems pretty weird i have to run the test with the all-in-one command and not standalone `npx hardhat test filepath` command .  I'll give it a try


[09/08/2022 10:27] illilli000
The all-in-one command ensures that wardens run all commands in the correct order. you had said that you modified some dependencies, and that's not required if you run the all-in-one command as provided


[09/08/2022 10:28] illilli000
thereafter, you can run tests however you like - it just sets everything up properly


[09/08/2022 10:30] cryptphi
alright then. will try it out.....


[09/08/2022 10:31] cryptphi
please can you confirm the decimals() value for wcanto?


[09/08/2022 10:35] illilli000
this is a question for the sponsor, not me, right?

Question: 

Best practice is to update state variables before calls to avoid reentrancy

But does this still apply if the contract uses safetransfer as the call 

So does safetransfer stop the vulnerability of updating state variables after calls

I find 24 hours too little time to understand the project and start reasoning about the issues

{Reactions}

[09/09/2022 06:33] indijanc7
Yep, would agree. While there's very small number of lines in scope, the overall project is huge and you need a lot of time to comprehend everything and understand how those few lines affect the whole system ... Feels like this one was intended more for wardens who worked on previous Canto contests. Still, with a good approach and maybe some luck I'm sure people found issues that will help out the Canto ecosystem.

[11/25/2022 10:15] colingplatt
hey guys, I pinged TK and I know that he shared some of the info. Resharing here for completeness.  1) I had a question about a straight-forward gas optimization, still sorting out my c4 registration to make the submission. 2) I had a question about batch distributions of fees, looking at the `evm_hooks.go` I'm not sure that's still applicable as each transaction is treated at each transaction.


[11/25/2022 10:21] colingplatt
I had another question (rather than a finding per se), there are a number of contracts currently active on the Canto network, I understand that there is no ability to retroactively allocate a turnstile NFT to previously deployed contracts. I believe that this will create a sizeable amount of additional work for early Canto contract deployers who have contracts linked to external services (e.g., DEXes on Coingecko), as well as a number of downstream effects if those contracts do upgrade and remove support for non-CSR-eligible contracts, including locked liquidity ERC20 tokens which will be forced to migrate (in the situation where a DEX migrates and removes support on the frontend for non-CSR contract).  I'll include a proposal in my submission that the authors consider integrating a function under `onlyOwner` that allows for batch assignment of Turnstile NFTs to remedy this.


[11/25/2022 15:53] .0xdave
I have a question. Who should I dm?


[11/25/2022 16:52] terpayyo
distributing all fees at the end of a block instead or by epoch?


[11/25/2022 16:59] colingplatt
Was trying to grok how evm_hooks works. Looks like it's saved every transaction? Or is it done every epoch?


[11/25/2022 17:00] terpayyo
after every transaction


[11/25/2022 17:00] colingplatt
Ok then please ignore that point


[11/25/2022 17:00] colingplatt
I'm having issues getting onto the C4 site to log it but I noted a gas optimisation to TK


[11/25/2022 17:00] colingplatt
Re the use of Counter


[11/25/2022 17:01] colingplatt
As you're using erc721enumerable


[11/25/2022 17:01] colingplatt
You can just use totalSupply and bin the counter


[11/25/2022 17:01] terpayyo
i agree completely. We had a discussion with the team and decided this was the best design decision for V1. However, once this is stable and live on mainnet the feature upgrade to support retroactive registration is probably the first upgrade we will ship to the module.


[11/25/2022 17:02] colingplatt
I logged a PR to CIP-001. I'm personally a bit concerned about how this might negatively impact projects already live. Perhaps the PR is the better venue for discussion

{Reactions}

[11/25/2022 17:02] colingplatt
I've got a PoC for the function that I can share with you as well


[11/25/2022 17:06] colingplatt
Also for usability and adoption it would probably make sense to overlay Turnstile this on an interface so developers on Canto can quickly integrate it (but again not sure this is the venue, albeit that would have a small impact on the implementation)

no wonder


[12/09/2022 07:41] 0xsorrynotsorry
Never the C4 or the judges. Many times it's due to mitigation implementation of the project.


[12/09/2022 09:08] bit.surfer
If you check at C4 docs [https://docs.code4rena.com/structure/our-process]  the "awards announced" is not in the same period as "Sponsors complete mitigation of any issues". Not sure if c4 changed their policy (if so, they should update the docs too)


[12/09/2022 10:02] cloudellie
That's right. We try to announce awards as soon as possible after judging is complete, but mitigations can take time, especially if complex vulnerabilities were discovered. We don't publish reports, or open the findings repos, until we have the sponsor's consent to do so, for reasons that are probably self-evident. 

If you have further questions, let's move them out of the contest channel and into a more general chat channel like #❓questions , please.


[12/09/2022 12:23] ladboy233
And that makes a lot of sense.

@Jay | C4 I  can see canto listed in mexc exchange but the deposit address is asking for chain. Can you please tell if correct chain is canto or canto evm?


[12/15/2022 17:26] itsmetechjay
@🐔👨🏼⚖ eric (ninek) | C4 can you chime in here?


[12/15/2022 17:33] nine_k
probably best to confirm with the Canto docs, this might be a good place to start https://docs.canto.io/user-guides/connecting-to-canto
